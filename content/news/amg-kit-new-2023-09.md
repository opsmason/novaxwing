Yesterday, Atomic Mass Games posted clarifications for questions about Store Championships. Of note:

- Store Championships require a minimum of 16 players.
- Stores are to report winners via a Google Form, provided by their Asmodee Sales Rep.
- The competitive season runs from May 4th to Jan 31.
- Legacy invites (those awarded before the COVID19 pandemic) will no longer be accepted. Players must win an invite during this season to play in Worlds 2024.
- Invites may be passed down if a store champion already has an invite.
- There will be a Last Chance Qualifier (LCQ) at AdeptiCon.
