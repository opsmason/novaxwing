It's already a busy X-Wing week at Atomic Mass Games.

On Monday, Atomic Mass Games launched their own [Discord server](https://discord.gg/atomicmassgamesofficial). There is not a Transmission article yet, but they announced it on various social media platforms. There are already channels for each of their games (Marvel Crisis Protocol, Legion, Shatterpoint, Armada, and X-Wing). There is also an X-Wing sub-channel called Find Local Game Communities, that is getting built out pretty well, with entried from all around the world.

On Tuesday, there was a nice [preview article for the YT-2400](https://www.atomicmassgames.com/transmission/yt-2400-light-freighter-preview/). We see images for the Leebo and Dash Rendar Standard Loadout cards, both Scum and Rebel. We also get images for the Rebel customizable ship cards. They have already specified rules questions will not be answered in Discord, and must be directed to the [rules forum](https://forums.atomicmassgames.com/forum/43-star-wars-x-wing-rules-questions/). 

Also on Tuesday, AMG posted an updated [Rules Reference (version 1.4.6, effective Sept. 15, 2023)](https://cdn.svc.asmodee.net/production-amgcom/uploads/2023/09/SWZ_RulesReference_v1.4.6-1.pdf). There were only two changes: one for Seismic Charges (page 26) and new errata for the Outrider title (page 33).

Seismic Charges now specify it is the obstacle, not the bomb, that deals damage. This change means that Sabine Wren Crew (After a ship suffers the effect of a friendly bomb …) and Grudge (While a friendly bomb or mine at range 0-2 detonates, each time attack dice are rolled to resolve its effect …) no longer trigger off of Seismic Charges. However, it's effect on Ablative Plating (Before you would suffer damage from an obstacle or from a friendly bomb detonating …) is intersting: the "freindly bomb" trigger no longer applies, but the "damage from obstacle" trigger applies, regardless of the friendliness of the bomb!

The Outrider Errata now overrides the title card that came from the conversiuon kit. In effect, there is only one Outrider title card now, the one that comes with the ["Black Box" YT-2400](https://www.atomicmassgames.com/character/yt-2400-light-freighter/).

X-Wing may not be getting any air time at [Ministravaganza](https://www.atomicmassgames.com/transmission/ministravaganza-2023-program-schedule-transmission/), but it is nice to see some updates.
