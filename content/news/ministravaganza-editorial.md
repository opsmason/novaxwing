AMG [posted a message](https://www.atomicmassgames.com/transmission/a-message-to-our-community/) reminding people to be civil during the [Ministravaganza](https://www.atomicmassgames.com/transmission/ministravaganza-2023-program-schedule-transmission/) online event, scheduled for Sept, 14 - 16. The state that they "... will not tolerate any action or comments that move beyond constructive criticism and instead push into the realm of personal attacks, willful ruining of other peopleâ€™s fun and enjoyment, or that violate any of our other community guidelines."

I can't help but feel like this is an indirect callout to a minor, but vocal, portion of the X-Wing community. I watched some of the [AMG painting streams](https://www.twitch.tv/atomicmassgames) for Legion or Shatterpoint, and there are always people asking about X-Wing product, points, or rules. Usually the questions are benign, but annoying. Sometimes they get out of hand.

Folks, please don't do this.
